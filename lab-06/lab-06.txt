1. The largest size string we could store into the variable char 
myString[10]; is 9 characters. One character is 
reserved for the null terminator ('\0').

2. The largest size string we can store of variable n is n-1

3. If a string has no null terminator, it won't be recognized as a 
 C-style string, and functions that operate on C-style strings 
will not work correctly. 

4. We can iterate through the characters in the string until we 
find a null terminator ('\0'). 

7. In this example, the copyString function is used to copy the 
content of the source string into the destination string. The copy 
function takes two parameters: dest, src

8. In this example, the swapStrings function is used to swap the content 
of two strings (str1 and str2). The swap function of the std::string class 
takes one parameter: str2, 

9. In this example, the insertSubstring function is used to insert a subStr 
into the mainStr at a specified position. The insert function of the 
std::string class takes three parameters: position, subStr. After the insertion, 
the mainStr will contain the subStr at the specified position. The insert 
function has multiple versions because it allows for various ways to specify 
the insertion position and substring, providing flexibility for different 
use cases.
