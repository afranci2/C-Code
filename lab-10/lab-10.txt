✅ Question 1. Considering the bubble sort algorithm we've just discussed, how many swaps are necessary to sort the following sequence? [2, 13, 6, 9, 3, 10, 8, 1, 5, 11]

✅ Question 2. Considering the selection sort algorithm we've just discussed, how many swaps are necessary to sort the following sequence? [2, 13, 6, 9, 3, 10, 8, 1, 5, 11]


✅ Question. Is this algorithm faster than the other two? Justify your answer.

✅ Question 3. Why can we not NULL terminate an integer array?

✅ Question 4. Write a function findMin that accepts an array of ints and returns the smallest value in that array.

✅ Question 5. Write a function findMaxIndex that accepts an array of ints and returns the index of the largest value in that array.

✅ Question 6. Write a function calculateMedian that accepts an array of ints and returns the median.

✅ Question 7. Write a function replace that accepts and array and two ints: x, and n. This function should replace all instances of x with n.

✅ Question 7. Write a function doubleEvens that accepts an array and doubles all of the even values in that array.

✅ Question 9. Write a function multiModify that accepts an array that triples all multiples of 3, doubles all multiples of 2, and ignores everything else. Note: A value should be able to be modified by multiple statements e.g. 6 would get tripled, then doubled.

✅ Question 10. Write a function split that accepts three arrays, original, evens, and odds. The function should accept all 3 by reference, extract the evens & odds from original, and store them into evens, and odds respectively. Note: You can use sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]) to get the # of elements in an array. This will only work within the scope that you declared the array in! You'll need to figure out how to get the # of arrays within the function.
